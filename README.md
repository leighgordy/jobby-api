# jobby-api
A TypeScript fetch api designed to work with [jobby rest project](https://github.com/leighgordy/jobby-rest).

I've built this for two purposes. 
* First to allow me to build demo frontend apps quickly. Don't want to tailor fetch for every application.
* its good design! We should not have our business/fetch logic muddled up in our frontend apps. Lets face it we will probably replace the frontend in a year or two. This makes that process easier.

## instructions
* `npm run build` - builds the ES6 code with .d.ts files
* `npm run lint` - runs the linter
* `npm run test` - runs the jest tests
* `npm run coverage` - runs the jest coverage

# Interesting Facts
First time I have written a TypeScript module. Not a fan but not that hard. Used to build Java apps all the terminology is the same.
